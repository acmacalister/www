# Projects

### [Chat Simply](http://www.chatsimply.com)

Designed around the idea of making group chat simple. Built off open standards and projects like XMPP, Backbone, Rails, Node.js, etc. My role was building a BOSH connection manager for clients and provide push notifications for iOS devices. I also built a node.js app that worked with external APIs to provide webhook intergrations into chat rooms. Built the OSX desktop app (web wrapper) and assisted on the iOS app.

### [Instee](http://www.insteeapp.com)

Social Networking app for friend making. I built the backend using Rails, ElasticSearch & Go. The app stack I deployed to our VPS uses Docker, Nginx, Unicorn, ElasticSearch, Postgres, Go and WebSockets.
