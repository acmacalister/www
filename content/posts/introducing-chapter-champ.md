I'm starting a company.

After years of building software for other people, I'm finally taking the leap and building something of my own. It's called **Chapter Champ**, and the mission is simple: get kids excited about reading.

## Why Reading?

We live in an age of endless distraction. Kids are drowning in short-form content, algorithmic feeds, and instant gratification. Meanwhile, some of the most important ideas that have shaped civilization sit on shelves gathering dust.

I want to change that. I believe classic literature has the power to shape young minds in ways that a TikTok video never will. There's something irreplaceable about getting lost in a great story, wrestling with complex ideas, and seeing the world through someone else's eyes.

Chapter Champ is my attempt to make that experience accessible and engaging for kids today.

## Developer to Founder

Let me be honest: I'm a developer by trade. I've spent my career writing code, shipping apps, and solving technical problems. Building a company? That's new territory.

I don't have an MBA. I haven't raised millions in venture capital. I'm not coming from a previous exit. I'm just a guy who knows how to build software and has an idea he believes in.

That's both terrifying and exciting.

## Building in Public

I've decided to document this journey with a weekly blog. Every week, I'll share what I'm working on, what I'm learning, and where I'm struggling. The good, the bad, and the embarrassing.

I'll cover everything:
- **Tech**: The stack, architecture decisions, and interesting problems I'm solving
- **Business**: Marketing, sales, pricing, and all the stuff I'm figuring out for the first time
- **Personal**: The mental game of entrepreneurship and what it's like to bet on yourself

## The First Milestone: $1k MRR

Every journey needs a destination. My first milestone is reaching **$1,000 in monthly recurring revenue**.

It's not a huge number, but it represents something important: proof that people will pay for what I'm building. Proof that this idea has legs.

I have no idea how long it will take. Could be months. Could be longer. But I'm committed to getting there, and I'm committed to sharing every step along the way.

## Follow Along

If you're interested in following this journey, check back here every week for updates. Whether you're a fellow developer thinking about starting something, a parent who cares about kids and reading, or just someone who enjoys watching people try hard things, I hope you'll find something valuable here.

Here we go.
